    #0 0x5bed580a60f2 in main samples/SAFE/__tmp_0a1b15c8.c:87

  This frame has 2 object(s):
    [32, 1052) 'entry' (line 108)
    [1184, 2208) 'line' (line 88) <== Memory access at offset 1052 partially underflows this variable
HINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork
      (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported)
